        üçä A Bit About Me
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This space is just me being me. Sharing the things I enjoy, the things
        I'm building, and the parts of life that bring real value. Whether
        it's a smooth Saturday morning walk, a fresh gym session to get my
        mind right, or cracking a tricky line of JavaScript over an oat milk
        flat white. I've started to appreciate the process as much as the
        result. Slow grind. Clean focus. Real progress.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I kicked things off as a brand manager after earning my master's at
        Loughborough University. It was creative, mid-energy, and taught me
        how to move smart in mid-paced spaces, but lacked incentive. From
        there, I transitioned into the finance world; helping people navigate
        major life decisions as a mortgage advisor. Impacting people's life on
        a big scale. It was solid work with real impact, but deep down, I
        wanted something with more freedom. More flow. More of me in it.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        That's when I started diving into tech out of pure curiosity. I picked
        up code, started building from scratch, and fell in love with the
        challenge, and with the structure and creativity it gives you. It's
        like the gym for your brain; and I'm hooked.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        These days, I keep it simple and intentional. Smoothie in the morning
        for the health kick. Walks with no distractions. A focused lift to
        reset. A few hours in a coffee shop soaking in the ambiance, tapping
        keys to a good playlist, learning something from nothing. That's the
        rhythm for me.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Not every day's a highlight reel for me, and that's more than cool
        with me. Some days you cruise. Other days you push. But as long as I'm
        showing up with presence and purpose, I know I'm in motion. Good
        energy with organic growth and hopefully solid results.
      </p>
